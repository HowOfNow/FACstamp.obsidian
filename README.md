# FACstamp.obsidian

FACstamp is digital signature applied to digital content.  The digital content can be text, audio, or video, and can part of an existing platform or application, from printed material to all digital.  The stamped content can be generated in/by mainstream media, social media, or any type of digital data collection.  Basically any type of digital data, human or AI generated, can be FACstamped.

Regarding the provenance of the person stamping the content, the content producer/purveyor needs to obtain a FACid prior to obtaining a FACstamp license, which is required to stamp content.  Only human beings can obtain a FACid and hence sign and obtain a FACstamp license agreement.

FACid's have strong boundaries of anonymity as well as identity.  And within these boundaries, a FACid is tied to voter registration in terms of name and address only.  Thus, corporations, governments, and AI implementations can neither obtain a FACid nor stamp content with a FACstamp.  However, it is possible for a group of FACids to sign a AI.FACstamp license agreement allowing for AI generated content to be digitally stamped in an analogous manner via a different license agreement.

The general public can use and leverage FACstamps without any license agreement.  However, as FACstamps come with an expressed warranty of fitness-for-use, to initiate a warranty claim against a specific FACstamp requires a FACid.

Two technical details of interest: 1) FACstamps are stored in a distributed Merkle Tree (blockchain like) database; and 2) FACstamps also are stored in a directed acyclic graph w.r.t. FACstamp references, enabling live FACid and FACstamp provenance status queries.
